Machine Learning helper functions

I created helper functions based on the code present in a great book _Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras and Tensorflow_. The author Mr. Geron has done an excellent job explaining the ML techniques with Python very well. I highly recommend this book for any aspiring ML engineers.
